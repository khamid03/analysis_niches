# Overview of Niches: Financial and Employment Trends Analysis (2011-2023)

This project analyzes the financial and employment trends in several key industries over the years 2011-2023. The data used in the analysis is derived from the [Annual Enterprise Survey 2023 Financial Year Provisional Size Bands](https://www.stats.govt.nz/information-releases/annual-enterprise-survey-2023-financial-year-provisional). The analysis focuses on three main sectors: **Electricity, Gas, Water and Waste Services**, **Health Care and Social Assistance**, and **Construction**.

## Project Overview

The main objective of this project is to provide insights into how these industries have evolved over the years in terms of:
- **Salaries and Wages Paid**
- **Sales, Government Funding, Grants, and Subsidies**
- **Total Income**
- **Employment Trends (Rolling Mean Employees)**

This analysis also highlights the impact of major global events, such as the COVID-19 pandemic, on these industries, particularly in terms of income fluctuation and government support.

## Dataset

The dataset used for this analysis is publicly available and can be accessed via [Stats NZ](https://www.stats.govt.nz/information-releases/annual-enterprise-survey-2023-financial-year-provisional). It includes data on various financial metrics and employment statistics across different industries.

## Key Sectors Analyzed

1. **Electricity, Gas, Water and Waste Services**:
   - Significant fluctuations in income during the pandemic years (2019-2021).
   - Increase in government subsidies to support households and businesses.
   
2. **Health Care and Social Assistance**:
   - Steady growth in wages and government funding, especially during the COVID-19 pandemic.
   - The sector saw a sharp rise in the number of employees due to increased demand for health services.
   
3. **Construction**:
   - Consistently strong performance in terms of wages and total income.
   - A steady increase in the number of employees, driven by population growth and urbanization.

## Visualizations

The project provides a series of visualizations that plot financial and employment metrics for each sector, including:
- Salaries and wages paid over time.
- Sales, government funding, and total income trends.
- Number of rolling mean employees in each sector by year.

These plots help in understanding the trends and major shifts in these industries over the specified time period.

## Dependencies

This project is implemented using Python in a Jupyter Notebook. The following libraries are required:
- `pandas`
- `matplotlib`

You can install these libraries using `pip`:
```bash
pip install pandas matplotlib
```

## How to Run the Project

1. **Download the dataset**: You need to download the dataset from the [Stats NZ website](https://www.stats.govt.nz/information-releases/annual-enterprise-survey-2023-financial-year-provisional).
2. **Set up the environment**: Ensure that you have Python installed, along with the required libraries (`pandas`, `matplotlib`).
3. **Run the Jupyter Notebook**: Open the `Overview_of_niches.ipynb` file in Jupyter and execute the cells to reproduce the analysis and visualizations.
   ```bash
   jupyter notebook Overview_of_niches.ipynb
   ```

## Future Improvements

Some potential future enhancements for the project include:
- Extending the analysis to additional industries.
- Incorporating more advanced machine learning techniques for trend prediction.
- Adding interactive visualizations using tools like `plotly` or `dash`.
